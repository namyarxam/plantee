Welcome to Plantee
Make a plant grow beyond belief, alone or with friends, all done via text message!

Plantee is a cool friend in the form of a plant! It will keep you engaged throughout the day with reminders via text message,
that it needs to be fed, loved, and kept happy. The user will create a plantee and allow other friends "gardeners"to aid him/her in the nourishment process of that specific plantee.

Plantee Creation:

When a user registers their account, they will be given a log in in order to create a profile.
During the profile input process, they will need to input first and last name and cell phone.
When they click submit, they will receive a verification code that needs to be inputted.
As soon as it is received and inputted into the system, the user will see the plantee!


Notification:

The user will receive notifications from Plantee via text message periodically throughout the day via twillio.
The user, based on plantees request, can send a response directly to plantee which will have either a positive or
negative effect on the plant, thus, will effect the plantee's HP bar. Plantees HP bar can be set at 100, as you maintain
plantee health well the bar will stay at 100. However, if you begin to neglect plantee, the HP bar will decrease gradually
up until plantee dies. Thats a waste of life and money!

Gardeners:

The user will have the option to invite friends aka gardeners whom will have the same tasks as the user except
they will work together in a group and be able to see all responses from each other rendered on the plantee page.
This is where the interactive gameplay takes place, users and gardeners will both be responding to text messages
and both parties will ultimately have an effect on plantee's health bar! How cool is that?!

Text Storage:

Will all be rendered on a page where all the users/gardeners can view the updates sent from the groups
cell phones. That way the user can see which gardener is doing well and which one is doing poorly.. and hey
maybe the whole team does well, but at least there will be a track record for accountability.


Additional Features:

In the future, users will be able to have multiple plantees and choose who they want to allocate certain
responsibilities to. They will also be able to create farms with different kinds of plantees
as well as create new jobs with new tasks, all allocated and distributed via text!

Potential sync with facebook, so friends can see you are playing plantee!
